🏥 Hospital Management System (C++)

This repository contains a console-based Hospital Management System developed in C++ using file handling techniques.
The system allows efficient management of patient records including insertion, searching, updating, deletion, and persistent storage without using a database.

✨ Key Features
1️⃣ Patient Record Management

Add new patient records

Display all stored patients

Search patients by Patient ID

Update existing patient information

Delete patient records

2️⃣ File-Based Storage System

Patient data is stored persistently using text files

No database required

Uses record packing and unpacking

📄 Data Format

ID|Name|Age|Disease|Address|Phone#


Each patient record is stored on a separate line inside:

patients.txt

3️⃣ Menu-Driven Interface

Simple and user-friendly console menu

Easy navigation between operations

Suitable for beginners and students

🛠️ Technical Implementation

Language: C++

Concepts Used:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Classes & Encapsulation

File Handling (fstream)

Sequential File Access

String Processing
